# Recursive patterns
We’re allowing patterns to contain other patterns:

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> GetEnrollees()
{
    foreach (var p in People)
    {
        if (p is Student { Graduated: false, Name: string name }) yield return name;
    }
}
```

The pattern `Student { Graduated: false, Name: string name }` checks that the Person is a Student, then applies the constant pattern false to their Graduated property to see if they’re still enrolled, and the pattern string name to their Name property to get their name (if non-null). Thus, if p is a Student, has not graduated and has a non-null name, we yield return that name.
